# Timex/Sinclair 2068 Bus Extender

This printed circuit board plugs into the expansion bus on the back of the Timex/Sinclair 2068 and provides four expansion slots.

## Features
- Relay switched power to the expansion bus
- Optional external power per expansion slot
- Power LED
- A means of passing the /BE signal forward to cards closer to the computer
- A TS2068 expansion bus for connecting other expansion devices

## Backward and Forward Compatibility

This expansion bus was designed to provide compatibility with older hardware that uses the /BE signal to implement its own ROM. 
Earlier disk drive systems, like the John Oliger disk drive system, used /BE to enable its internal ROM when the user issued
certain commands.

The expansion bus has jumpers to map the /BE signal (pin 29A) to BUSISO (pin 30B). Expansion cards configured to recognize
/BE coming in on BUSISO, like the TS Pico, will disable themselves and pass the /BE forward to the computer. This should
prevent bus contention between a John Oliger disk system and the TS Pico.

Each slot has a jumper to enable this /BE pass-forward feature. It can use a standard pin jumper or a switch wired to a jumper connector.

## Power

The TS2068 power supply can provide power to a limited number of expansion devices. This board includes options for external 5 volt power and 
the ability to select external/internal power per slot (and the extension of the expansion bus). Power to the board is switched by a relay.
